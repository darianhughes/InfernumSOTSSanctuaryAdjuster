A mod that allows you to move the spawn location of the SOTS Sanctuary biome. 

By default, this only affects the world generation if you have Infernum or Spooky Mod enabled, and moves the biome closer to the center of the world so it doesn't interfere with the Brimstone Crags biome from Calamity. 

You are able to fully customize the spawn location in the config, as well as disable the Infernum/Spooky requirement for this generation.
