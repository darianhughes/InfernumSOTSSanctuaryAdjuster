A mod that adjusts the spawn location some of the Secrets of the Shadows' biomes and structures.
Right now this includes the Sapphire Gem Structure and the Sanctuary biome.

This was primarily made for my other mod Infernal Eclipse of Ragnarok but doesn't require it, and does nothing if you do not have Secrets of the Shadows enabled.

Sapphire Gem Structure:
By default the Sapphire Gem Structure is only moved when Wrath of the Gods is enabled, and it moves it to the bottom left corner of the Ice Biome instead of the botom right to avoid conflicts with the Permafrost Keep structure from Wrath of the Gods. You can also disable the Wrath of the Gods requirement in the config for this generation.

Santuary Biome:

How to use:
- Easiest: Fraction mode -

Mode = Fraction

LeftFraction = 0.30 // jungle on right → place at 30% of world

RightFraction = 0.70 // jungle on left → place at 70%

(leave MinMarginTiles = 300)

- Tiles mode (set both sides to same distance from edge) -

Mode = Tiles

Small (4200 wide): LeftTiles = 1260, RightTilesFromRightEdge = 1260

Medium (6400): LeftTiles = 1920, RightTilesFromRightEdge = 1920

Large (8400): LeftTiles = 2520, RightTilesFromRightEdge = 2520

- Nudge mode (move original 1/8 or 7/8 inward) -

Target ~30%/70%:

Small: NudgeTilesTowardCenter = 735

Medium: 1120

Large: 1470

(Formula if your world size is custom: Fraction target f ⇒ Tiles = round(f * Main.maxTilesX); Nudge ⇒ round((f - 0.125) * Main.maxTilesX).)

Please note that messing with these settings could break your world and/or cause the world generation to fail as messing with World Generation is very messy, especially when messing with another mod's world gen.
