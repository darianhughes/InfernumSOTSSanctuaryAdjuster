A mod that allows you to move the spawn location of the SOTS Sanctuary biome. 
This was primarily made for my other mod, Infernal Eclipse of Ragnarok but doesn't require it and only requires SOTS as a dependency.

By default this only effects the world generation if you have Infernum or Spooky Mod enabled, and move the biome closer to the center of the world so it doesn't interfere with the Brimstone Crags biome from Calamity, but you are able to fully customize the spawn location in the config, as well as disable the Infernum/Spooky requirement for this generation.

How to use:
- Easiest: Fraction mode -

Mode = Fraction

LeftFraction = 0.30 // jungle on right → place at 30% of world

RightFraction = 0.70 // jungle on left → place at 70%

(leave MinMarginTiles = 300)

- Tiles mode (set both sides to same distance from edge) -

Mode = Tiles

Small (4200 wide): LeftTiles = 1260, RightTilesFromRightEdge = 1260

Medium (6400): LeftTiles = 1920, RightTilesFromRightEdge = 1920

Large (8400): LeftTiles = 2520, RightTilesFromRightEdge = 2520

- Nudge mode (move original 1/8 or 7/8 inward) -

Target ~30%/70%:

Small: NudgeTilesTowardCenter = 735

Medium: 1120

Large: 1470

(Formula if your world size is custom: Fraction target f ⇒ Tiles = round(f * Main.maxTilesX); Nudge ⇒ round((f - 0.125) * Main.maxTilesX).)

Please note that messing with these settings could break your world and/or cause the world generation to fail as messing with World Generation is very messy, especially when messing with another mod's world gen.
